As a Software Engineer I design and implement scalable and secure web applications and APIs using Python, and PostgreSQL. I collaborate with the front-end team, the product team, and the clients to deliver high-quality solutions that meet the business and user needs. 

I have a strong background in software engineering, having graduated from Yarmouk University with a degree in Computer Science and completed a software development technical training program with ASAC | LTUC in partnership with CodeFellows. I also have experience as a Full-stack Developer using Python, PHP, React.js, and MySQL. I am passionate about learning new technologies and solving complex problems, and I am always eager to take on new challenges and opportunities.
