Hello everyone, 
I am Mohammad Salhab. I am from Jordan-Irbid, GMT+2 time zone.
I recently graduated from  Yarmouk University, with Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, The first programming language I learned was C++, I struggled in it at first but then and after I solved many problems with it, it was very easy to learn and understand other programming languages like Java, JavaScript, and python. I was in an internship for two weeks in writing content about IT topics for children, it was a very fun internship and I learned a lot from it. I am interested in Machine learning, Data Science and Robotics and I hope we get into these topics in this course.
I work on windows 10 with:
Processor :Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8250U CPU @ 1.60GHz   1.80 GHz
RAM : 8.00 GB
System Type:64-bit operating system, x64-based processor
